description: Sweep StatSeer's pages in the dev browser for the visual/layout bugs Derek keeps catching by eye — unequal card heights, horizontal overflow, dead space, invisible/low-contrast text, collapsed (zero-size) elements, clipped text, click-intercepted buttons, broken images. Use for a "maintenance day" pass, before a deploy, or whenever asked to check the app/website for visual bugs across pages. Runs an automated DOM probe at desktop + mobile and light + dark, then reports ranked candidates for Derek to approve — replacing the screenshot-and-send loop.

# StatSeer visual audit

## Why this exists
Derek used to find visual bugs by eye and screenshot them one at a time. ~80% of those fall into a
handful of mechanically-detectable classes. This skill drives the dev preview across a page checklist
and runs an in-page probe that flags those classes, so the job becomes *review a ranked list and
approve fixes* instead of *spot and screenshot*. Subjective calls (tone, "looks clunky", whether a CTA
says the right thing) still belong to Derek — the audit only surfaces candidates.

## Bug classes it detects
`page-overflow-x` (body scrolls sideways) · `unequal-row-height` (cards in a row differ in height) ·
`zero-size` (a button/img/badge that's visible but 0×0 — the "green ring not showing" family) ·
`clipped-text` · `low-contrast-text` (the filled-bar-blank / invisible-text family) ·
`click-intercepted` (a control covered by an overlay — the "move button doesn't work" family) ·
`broken-image`. Console errors + network 4xx/5xx are collected separately (see step 4).

## Prerequisites (already in the repo)
- **QA preview mode** is automatic on the local dev server: `web/proxy.ts` opens the gate when
  `NODE_ENV==="development"`, and `web/lib/supabase/client.ts` mocks `auth.getUser/getSession` so
  gated client components (LeftRail, dashboards) hydrate with a mock member. Production is untouched.
  Requires `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in `web/.env.local` (public
  values; already added). Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_QA_PREVIEW=0` to force a real signed-out dev session.
- **The probe** lives at `web/qa/visual-audit.js` — a self-contained, pasteable IIFE that returns JSON.

## Procedure
1. **Start the preview**: `preview_start { name: "web" }`. (Restart if `proxy.ts`/`.env.local` changed.)
2. **Host the probe for the run** so it can be re-fetched per page without re-pasting:
   `cp web/qa/visual-audit.js web/public/__ss_audit.js` — **delete this file before committing.**
3. **For each page × viewport × theme** in the matrix below:
   - `navigate` to the URL, then in `javascript_tool`:
     `await new Promise(r=>setTimeout(r,1500)); JSON.parse(eval(await (await fetch('/__ss_audit.js?v='+Date.now())).text()))`
   - Sizes: `resize_window {width:1440,height:900}` (desktop, exercises the rail gutter),
     `resize_window {preset:"mobile"}` (overflow hides here). Themes: add `colorScheme:"dark"` /
     `"light"`. Reset with `resize_window {preset:"desktop"}` when done.
   - Collect the `findings[]`. One `low-contrast-text` or `unequal-row-height` at desktop-light is
     often enough to file; overflow is mobile-specific; contrast bugs often only show in one theme.
4. **Pull page errors** that the probe can't see: `read_console_messages {onlyErrors:true}` and
   `read_network_requests` (look for 4xx/5xx).
5. **Triage before reporting** — confirm each finding is real, not a probe limitation (below). For a
   suspicious contrast/overlap hit, inspect the element's computed `color` / `backgroundColor` and
   `elementFromPoint(center)` to confirm. Report a ranked list grouped by severity; recommend fixes;
   let Derek approve. Do not mass-fix without review.

## Page matrix (adjust per task)
Public/content (render fully in QA mode): `/`, `/model?week=1`, `/best?week=1`, `/props?week=1`,
`/considerations?week=1`, `/ncaaf/model`, `/ncaaf/best`, `/bankroll`, `/dashboard`, `/creator`.
Always include: `/` and `/model` at **mobile** (overflow) and one page in **dark** (contrast).

## Known limitations (state these, don't fight them)
- **Server-auth-gated pages redirect** in QA mode (the mock is client-only): `/u/[username]` (profile)
  and possibly `/settings` bounce to home. Audit those on the **live** site while logged in.
- **Founder-only UI is hidden**: the mock profile read is empty, so `role` falls back to "member"
  (no Creator Dashboard rail item). Navigate to `/creator` directly to see that page.
- **Text over background images** can't be contrast-checked (the probe skips it) — a nav/card over a
  photo won't be assessed either way.
- **Dev CSS-ordering quirks**: a contrast/background finding that only appears in dev may not
  reproduce in production — confirm ambiguous ones against the live site before asserting a prod bug.
- Tune thresholds via `window.__SS_AUDIT_CFG = { rowHeightTol, contrastMin, maxPerType }` before eval.

## Cleanup
Remove `web/public/__ss_audit.js`, `resize_window {preset:"desktop"}`, and (if you set it) clear the
`colorScheme` emulation before finishing. The probe (`web/qa/visual-audit.js`) and QA mode stay.
